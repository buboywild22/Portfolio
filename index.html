  <!-- About Me -->
  <div id="phil" class="" >
      <h1 class="text-center text-decoration-underline">About Me</h1>
        <h2 class="m-5 text-danger">A Little About Myself</h2>
          <h3 class="m-5">I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn more and new skills that helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to install networking physically and some security measures. I soon became the go-to person if there is trouble regarding the network.</h3>
          <h3 class="m-5">I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward. I’m not comfortable with settling, and I’m always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness. In my previous role, I was promoted three times in less than two years.”</h3>
          <h3 class="m-5">I’m a natural leader. I’ve eventually been promoted to a leadership role in almost every job because I like to help people. I find co-workers usually come to me with questions or concerns even when I’m not in a leadership role because if I don’t know the answer, I’ll at least point them in the right direction. In my last two roles, I was promoted to leadership positions after less than a year with the company.</h3>
        <h2 class="m-5 text-danger">Hobbies</h2>
          <h3 class="m-5">Listening to music lowers stress and elevates my mood. It strengthens learning and memory abilities, too.</h3>
          <h3 class="m-5">I like sports, whether it is team or individual sports. To enumerate some, I play basketball, volleyball, chess, swimming and table tennis</h3>
        <h2 class="m-5 text-danger">Philosophy in Life</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="philo">My philosophy is simple: love God and love others. I don’t have to believe this and neither do you, which is what’s so great about free will; you can choose what to believe and what to follow. God gave humanity freedom to choose to follow Him, or to reject Him, to choose good or to choose evil, to choose to believe in Christ or deny him. This idea of “free will” is a cornerstone of Christian belief, and is something we Christians believe all humans were created with.
                Because of the freedom God gives us, you can make up your own personal philosophy and live however you want. You can follow Plato, Jung, Buddha, Hinduism, Muhammed, Jesus or no one at all. God, being a loving Father, asks that you follow Christ and have faith in him, but out of his great love, and respect for your free will, also gives you the choice to reject this offer                
                Your religion and philosophy is what you choose it to be. God loves you and wants you to choose Him, but the choice is ultimately yours and yours alone to make.</h3>
            </li>
            <li class="philo">Another philosophy on my life is that you should live while you are alive and you should give others that same privilege. We shouldn’t judge people for the choices they make, because we all make bad decisions. You should do what you want with your life, as long as it makes you happy and causes no harm to others. Happiness is all we can hope for in this world and we have to strive to achieve it. We should help people when we can and graciously accept failures when we have to.</li>
            <li class="philo">The best way for people to live is to work hard and strive for success. People should be compassionate towards others and live life to the fullest. We have to make and maintain friendships. We have to try to advance in our careers and raise families. We have to try and help …show more content…
              Being a good person means being a considerate person who thinks about the consequences of their decisions and the effects of their actions on others. Good people take care of themselves and their friends and try to make personal relationships a priority. Good people also tend to take the high road and be the bigger person in an argument. Generally, they will work to meet important deadlines and be helpful when they can. They try to succeed and take their work very seriously. They are good friends to others and try to treat everyone with respect.</li>
            <li class="philo">Good people aren’t always moral people. This is because moral people seem to be more concerned with rules and laws and are sure to follow them. Good people, in my opinion, do what they think they must to do what is right.</li>
